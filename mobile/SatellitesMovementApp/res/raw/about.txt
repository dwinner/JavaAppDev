This is just a test application for Android platform, which demonstrates
some details for the development of mobile platform.
In this example, I have also tried to demonstrate
how quickly you can adapt itself to the development of
relatively simple applications for Android platform,
If you are already an experienced Java and/or, may be, C#/.NET.
List some of the issues that could affect in this little project:

- Development of UI-widgets using declarative syntax of XML;
- Development of UI-widgets programmatically;
- Create your own layout managers;
- The use of frame animation;
- The use of layout animation;
- The use of view animation;
- Persistence of the application;
- Some simple principles of elementary geometry;

If you are used to create custom
interface fourth generation using declarative
syntax in JavaFX 2.0/WPF, then this approach will seem
familiar. Actually it allows us to use the well-familiar MVC, but implicitly.
Generations under a UI I mean:
1st Generation: Creating a UI programmatically in the procedural style, for example, using Win32 API;
2nd Generation: Creating UI programmatically in OOP style for example, using MFC;
3rd Generation: Creating a UI programmatically or by to appropriate tools IDE, using high-
   libraries, for example, Windows Forms, Swing, SWT;
4th Generation: Creating UI declaratively using libraries are able to generate UI XML-based markup
   For example, WPF, JavaFX 2.0;
