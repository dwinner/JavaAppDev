<h3>Display Shelf for Mobile</h3>

<p>The original Display Shelf example uses the
<code>PerspectiveTransform</code>. This effect is not available on mobile
devices but a display shelf like navigation system is still useful to have on
smaller screens. This example shows how to modify the desktop <b>DisplayShelf</b> sample to work on a mobile
device.</p>
