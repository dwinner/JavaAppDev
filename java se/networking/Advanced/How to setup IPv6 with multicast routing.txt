1. Check windows registry parameter for Tcpip6:

   a) Win+R, then regedit;
   b) Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip6\Parameters\DisabledComponents;
   c) Change the value from 0xff to 0x20;
   d) Restart the PC: shutdown /r /t 0;
   e) Now enter the following command in cmd.exe: netsh int ipv6 show int;
      you should see at least 2 interfaces, something like that:
      Idx     Met         MTU          State                Name
      ---  ----------  ----------  ------------  ---------------------------
      1          75  4294967295  connected     Loopback Pseudo-Interface 1
      4          25        1500  connected     Local Area Connection
2. Check IP configuration:

   a) Enter ipconfig /all in cmd: ipconfig /all;
   b) If you see under your ethernet adapter something like that:
      Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : fe80::8473:d3fc:635c:af0b%4(Preferred)
      for Link-local IPv6 Address, than this step is passed;
      
3. Enabling multicast for your router:
   
   If you are going to test not just only on loopback address, but, i.e., on the local subnet:
   
   a) In cmd.exe, try to ping predefined DNS for multicasting: ping all-routers.mcast.net
   b) If you see "request timed out" and you received "0" bytes, then
      multicasting is disabled for your router; try the folowing link for solution:

   c) If you are able to uncheck the Automatic Metric and set it to 0, than
      ping all-routers.mcast.net should work fine;
